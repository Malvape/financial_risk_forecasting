# Financial Risk Forecasting

This repository includes some teaching material I developed while working at the [Systemic Risk Centre](http://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk). It is meant to be used mainly in the LSE postgraduate course [*FM442: Quantitative Methods for Finance and Risk Analysis*](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/courseGuides/FM/2019_FM442.htm).

For a good visualization please download the material, since github preview is not the best.
